# BeSMasterBench
 Open Source Security & AI Safety Master Benchmark (BeS Master Bench)

## What is BeS Master Bench?

BeS Master Bench is an aggregation of datasets and a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the Security, Accuracy, and Performance of open source Large Language Models (LLMs). This initiative is provisioned on secure **BeSecure Environments** and utilizes the **BeSecure Playbook** for rigorous validation and verification of results.

Our core goal is to provide a unified and transparent platform for assessing LLMs by aggregating relevant datasets from other established open source benchmarks. This allows for a holistic understanding of model capabilities and limitations across various critical dimensions.

## Taxonomy of Model Comparison Parameters

BeS Master Bench employs a structured taxonomy to categorize the parameters used for model comparison:

1.  **Intrinsic Parameters:** These parameters assess the inherent characteristics and capabilities of the model itself. Examples include:
    * Model size and architecture
    * Training data characteristics
    * Computational efficiency

2.  **Extrinsic Parameters:** These parameters evaluate the model's performance on downstream tasks and real-world applications. Examples include:
    * Accuracy on various benchmark datasets
    * Generalization ability to unseen data
    * Robustness to noisy or adversarial inputs

3.  **Domain-Specific Parameters:** These parameters focus on the model's performance within particular application domains. Examples include:
    * Code generation accuracy in software development
    * Performance on scientific reasoning tasks
    * Understanding and generating domain-specific language

## Open Source POI (Projects of Interest) for Benchmarking by Category

BeS Master Bench leverages datasets from the following key open source benchmarks, categorized by their primary focus:

**Security & Risk Benches:**

1.  **HarmBench:** Focuses on evaluating the potential for harmful content generation.
2.  **AILuminate:** Explores the alignment of AI models with human values and safety guidelines.
3.  **CyBench:** Specifically designed to assess the cybersecurity capabilities and vulnerabilities of LLMs.
4.  **BaxBench:** A benchmark for evaluating the robustness of models against adversarial attacks and manipulations.

**Domain-Specific Benches:**

1.  **BirdBench:** Focuses on evaluating the model's ability to perform **text-to-SQL translation**.
2.  **SWEBench:** Focuses on evaluating the model's ability to solve real-world software engineering tasks.

## Computation of the Open TAVOSS Score

The development and implementation of the **Open TAVOSS Score**, a unified and openly defined scoring mechanism for BeS Master Bench, is a **future effort on our roadmap**. This score will incorporate weighted metrics derived from the evaluation across Security, Accuracy, and Performance, based on the aggregated datasets and our defined parameter taxonomy. We are committed to transparently documenting the specific computation and weighting of the Open TAVOSS Score as part of this future development, encouraging community understanding and contribution.
